 # Introduction:
A graduate computing student has normally taught multiple programming languages as software is also written using these multiple languages.
  If a developer is trying to learn a new programming language then he or she will obviously try to search online to find information regarding the code and examples. But if a CS graduate who is trying to learn a new language he will face difficulty .. A developer has mastered multiple languages if he is learning a new language then his previous experience with other languages can interfere with one that he is learning. When he is searching for a code or a example he will understand how a developer search during his work. From previous searches it is experienced that code search for language learners is difficult than development activities.
  >for example a scenerio is given in which a CS student gets an internship and his manager thought that he is experienced and said to program in VBA which is a programming language developed by microsoft he started searching online his previous experience with java interfered, and question that come in his mind is " Is any other way is there to improve search success? " 
  
  One methodology involves logging and browser activities . some points are there to improve searching which are as follows :
  +  use natural language phrases such as 'if statment' rather that shortcuts like 'if'.
  +  should search for documentaton and examples instead of questions and answers.
  +  reformulation is quicker after previous query then searching for new query.
  +  include examples and code when when require new APIs.
  +  term borrowing was used which give support to learners.
 As if a learner will search through a code he will get much more experiences from these seacrches and it will help in his upcoming future.
# Research Methodology:
  We have 3 research questions for this study
1) Why do language learners search ? 
 They usually search for finding code to resolve bugs
2) What does a typical search session contain?
 3 outcomes were recorded 
  + An average participant spent above minutes. 
  + second is the length of learners query is greater than previous work(5.6 word VS 1.9 words) 
  + third is learners require longer time to search result than experts.
3) What are the factors that impact on searched query success for learners?
 Out of 107, 71 searches were successful . Documentation is indicative of success than Q&A And language learners borrows terms from languages so these queries are more successfulnWhen surveys were made on working on VBA tasks the similarities and differences between previous and new study are the garduate students participants perform tasks with the language they haven't learned and more response was collected in this study .The duration of original study was 15 days and for this was 90 min lab session. Participants involved for original were 27 google developers and for this study is 18 graduate students VBA is chosen because it's commmonly used with many online resources but graduate students have not learned this language . The research was conducted for a study on how computing students search for code in an unfamiliar programming language with 18 graduate students working on VBA tasks in a lab environment. There are 5 VBA tasks given to them form which one of them is creating button which creates a nessage box with (Hello World) .
 When one of these functions are performed survey is triggered .
 **_A google Chrome extension :_** is developed which records what a participant search and browsing history then deploy serveys when prticipant
 **_Install the extension :_**  in which their background information such as programming experiences, why they are searching code are seen
 Make a google search in chrome browser : in which participants are asked about what they search and how they are solving
 **_Reformulate a query :_**  asks about whether it's related to previous one or whether it solve the problem , if solved then how it helped if not then what is skipped.
 **_Close the research tab :_**  it's also same as reformulation .. Survey will not be triggerd by any event or it reaches limit.

# Result:
  From these researches it is found that " Learners require longer time to scan searches , reformulation is much faster after a previous query than searching for a new topic, term borrowing was commonly used .. Documentation led more successful searches then Q&A."

 # INTRODUCTION:
  Gender equality is creating much problem for many countries . Here a discussion is about a country finland which has good gender equality almost in every field. But there are some fields in which women face problems and in those areas men are considered dominant For Example fields like engineering and technology. The main purpose of the topic is to focus on the problem of women that the are facing for applying in software engineering due to earlier experiences.
  Finland could improve when women will take part in technology . The comparision is made between Finland and Europe that UNESCO reports only 22 percent graduate in engineering students are women and 28 percent scientist and engineers are women and in European country like Lithuania it is 58 percent .But what if women herself by her own choice don't apply in technolgy related field even though she is interested but because of past experiences and this will affect their confidence and self efficacy. It is because the history of finland when male were dominant Another reason is in childhood what she has taught and seen whould also have impact on their educational choices.
  If more women whould be recruited and appreciated in these fields then the country may move towards success. And the women should not be pressurized by any one to choose what they should do in her future.

# RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:
 A survey is done and in this survey 252 respondants were there who were mostly women who were intrested in 
 S.E roles and was already in that fields.
**_RESEARCH QUESTIONS_**
What experiences have impact on why they are not applying for software engineering roles?
Three experiences were shared 
+ **_Early School Experiences :_** In early School boys have their own computers and they can do everything but on girls side they don't have opportunity to have computer in school and parents also don't allow them.
+ **_Higher Education Experiences :_** This is about making dicision in higher education the girl's self confidence decrease because of the thought that engineering related occcupations are just associated with men.
+ **_Working Life Experiences :_** Even from the barriers of earlier experiences some women took part in software engineering roles but in same companies still the men are dominant.
Here we are not showing difference between girls and boys but wants to know what is the cause that prevent women from attempting to S.E roles. In survey the women are taking part who are already in that field or they have interest in computing. Survey was divided in 4 parts.
1) 4 variables or components of attitude towards computing described in 12 questions. 1) cognitive(negative thought) that there are many opportunities of engineering but would likely to be taken by men 2)Affective : worried about computing activities 3)Behavioral To learn something new.
2) Self efficacy which measure both general and computing self efficacy.
3) Personal experience : was about present and past experiences.
4) Demographic Questions : In this statistical characteristics of human population is asked.
48 questions were consisted of 254 respondants from which 2 didn't participate so remaining were 252 those are women majority has completed their higher education and majority were of the age 30-39. Then the research model was analyzed and validated.
# RESULT:
 The hypothesis about negative finding is cognitive attitude have a negative effect about working in technology because the questions were finding such a way that is a negative perception where as computer self efficacy has a positive perception about the person's skills so higher the values in cogniitive the more negative is the perception about technology career and the higher the computer efficacy the greater is the perticipants view about computing skills.
# MESSAGE:
If we have to improve or change the situation for women in software engineering requires stratgies that do not only change individual component but to change perceptions of society as a whole that who can take part in technology and who can not.

# Introduction :
  As we know social media is most commonly used in today's generation like facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Skype ,LinkedIN itc.but especially twitter has much impact on the lives of software developers as it is used for helping or facilitating people in communication , sharing information and for advertising someone's work. But here the main focus is on how developer use twitter and how they share their work. But when we come to validate this theory especially for impact of twitter on outcome of projects. There is lack of research because open source developer sometimes use multiple platforms So we cross link users on github and Twitter,  and found 70,427 users those which have  accounts on Twitter and github and there were 786 tweets about the work on github.

# Importance:
Social media has great impact on person's life and different people have different aim of using social sites most commonly for communication But twitter is most popular with software developers and we recognize developers from other people as the way of using URLs and other features when twitting . When python contributers are tweeting they mostly twitt about community related topics and software related topics. Twitter can help in maintaining relationship among developers and an open source
project use twitter mostly for advertising the project and to make it popular.
# Research Methodology:
We cross link github and twitter accounts on the basis of profiles and emailaddress. If they share same email address in both accounts they would be linked but if some people have multiple emails they won't be linked and if we will search with the help of names it will also not be linked because different people have same names.
  If we see URL and if it points to twitter account then this pair would be considered. If it points to the nonTwitter then we look for the URL that points to twitteraccount and then consider this pair. In this way 72,688 Github_Twitter accounts pair were found. Then we validate these accounts First we look towards many Github accounts which were linked to only one Twitter account then 70,427 pair remain. The accounts which are exccluded were used by organization.  Then 50 Github-Twitter accounts pair were randomly selected from which 3 were not using accounts, 40 were valid users, 6 belongs to organization, 1 account is used by another user. From these70,427 tweets we see for the URL that points to github.com and 131,217 tweets were there. From result it is seen that github and twitter are related .
So we characterize the authors of tweets in terms of their role in the mentioned repository when using twitter 6 tweet categories in total are as follows:
**_Tweets for_**
1) Advertisement 2) Work discussion 3) Information sharing 4) Answers 5) Questions 6) Call for Action
**_Github project role:_**
Authors , Calloborator , Contributer , Follower, Other
 Then different twitting of different stackholders is seen as owner mostly advertize and share information, contributer and followers have same pattern of twitting When twitting user advertising have higher percentage then sharing information then work discussion then answering then questions then call for action . 
People who tweet for link of github are not directly related to that repository which they mentioned they mostly tweet for advertising and to share work.
# Result:
70427 Github-Twitter account were linked and were researched and most tweets are for advertising and sharing information and promoting work. The social media activities have impact on software development outcomes . The effect of twitter activity on a project is they attract new contributers ,provide technical support.
